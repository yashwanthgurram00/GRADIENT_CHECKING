# GRADIENT_CHECKING
Gradient Checking Often times, it is normal for small bugs to creep in the backpropagtion code. There is a very simple way of checking if the written code is bug free. It is based on calculating the slope of cost function manually by taking marginal steps ahead and behind the point at which the gradient is returned by backpropagation.
